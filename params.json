They are `~/Dropbox` and `~/bin/dropbox.py`. These are the paths by default.\r\n\r\n## Debugging\r\n\r\nIf you notice, that this script doesn't do anything, try run it from a terminal. You may have unmet dependencies, or other paths.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Take a screenshot with the chosen keyboard shortcut.\r\n2. You might have to wait for a second or two, while dropbox finishes the upload.\r\n3. The short URL of your fresh screenshot will be on your clipboard.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf you want to use it in other environments, please send a pull request on a new branch.\r\n","name":".gnome-grabbox","google":"UA-35915314-2"}
